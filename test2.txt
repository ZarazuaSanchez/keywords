THE RESULT WAS A LIGHTWEIGHT, HARDWEARING BATTERY THAT COULD BE CHARGED HUNDREDS OF TIMES BEFORE ITS PERFORMANCE DETERIORATED. THE ADVANTAGE OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES IS THAT THEY ARE NOT BASED UPON CHEMICAL REACTIONS THAT BREAK DOWN THE ELECTRODES, BUT UPON LITHIUM IONS FLOWING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE ANODE AND CATHODE.
